Purpose
-------
The purpose of "recast" is to augment Google's excellent Chromecast device by
enabling casting to multiple devices, vis a vis whole-home audio or video.

Methodology
-----------
recast will work by performing the following:

(1) Existing on individual nodes throughout the network. A node consists of a
    computer <a> connected to either a TV or speaker.
(2) Providing a single front-facing ChromeCast receiver service, usable by any 
    device able to cast to a Chromecast on the network.
(3) recasting the received Chromecast signal to any other peer node, or to
    any other bona fide ChromeCast device in parallel.
(4) Providing an HTML5 interface so that the user may specify which other
    node(s) or Chromecast(s) to cast to.

Clearly, Chromecast may not be used in order to "recast" to other Chromecasts,
as no access is provided to the Chromecast without rooting the device. However,
Chromecast as a device choice does still serve an important aspect in the
"recast" ecosystem: cheap and easily-configurable clients of the "recast"
household.

Dependencies and Acknowledgments
--------------------------------
recast makes use of the following libraries and software:

* pychromecast, by balloob
  API for interfacing w/Chromecasts
  github.com/balloob/pychromecast

* python, by Guido van Rossum, et al.
  Beautiful and simple programming language
  python.org

* Django, by Django Software Foundation
  python-based FOSS web framework; powers node selection interface
  djangoproject.com

* sqlite, by D. Richard Hipp, et al.
  pysqlite, by unknown author
  database backend used by Django
  sqlite.org
    
Footnote <a>: Ideally, RaspberryPi or some other cheap, disposable computer
              could be used for each node. RaspberryPi already comes equipped
              with an HDMI port for TVs, and a 3.5 mm stereo audio jack for
              speakers.

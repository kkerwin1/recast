Purpose
-------
The purpose of "recast" is to augment Google's excellent ChromeCast device by
enabling casting to multiple devices, vis a vis whole-home audio or video.

Methodology
-----------
"recast" will work by performing the following:

(1) Existing on individual nodes throughout the network. A node consists of a
    computer <a> connected to either a TV or speaker.
(2) Providing a single front-facing ChromeCast receiver service, usable by any 
    device able to cast to a ChromeCast.
(3) "recast"ing the received ChromeCast signal to any other peer node, or to
    any other bona fide ChromeCast device in parallel.
(4) Providing an HTML5 interface so that the user may specify which other
    node(s) or ChromeCast(s) to cast to.

Clearly, ChromeCast may not be used in order to "recast" to other ChromeCasts,
as no access is provided to the ChromeCast without rooting the device. However,
ChromeCast as a device choice does still serve an important aspect in the
"recast" ecosystem: cheap and easily-configurable clients of the "recast"
household.
    
Footnote <a>: Ideally, RaspberryPi or some other cheap, disposable computer
              could be used for each node. RaspberryPi already comes equipped
              with an HDMI port for TVs, and a 3.5 mm stereo audio jack for
              speakers.
